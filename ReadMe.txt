INSTRUCTIONS


PYTHON FILES 

----    The RunCode.py program runs the code. The following parameters must be 
	specified in terminal when running the code in this order.

        Run part (a) and (b) using:
        'python RunCode_partAB.py N'

        Run part (c), (d) and (e) using:
        'python RunCode_partCDE.py N'

        Parameters:
            N - Matrix length -> NxN size 


            example: 'python RunCode.py 50'
                      This would run the simultion for matrix sized NxN


----    The PlotData.py file uses the stored data files in the pre-simulated data directory /Data/ to 
	plot specified in the questions. The plotting is controlled by a main() function located at the 
	bottom of the file.



----    The Functions_AB.py and Functions_CDE.py contains all the functions used in the exam.



COMMENTS ON DATA AND GRAPHS FOR MARKING



REQUESTED ANSWERS/COMMENTS TO EXAM QUESTIONS: 

part (a)

part (b)

    The pattern which appears initally takes a spiral patten continuosly.
    The system continues to fluctuate in a spiral pattern. I have attached a snapshot/screenshot.
    My laptop cannot run the 100x100 matrix as its going too slow. I could only run the 100x100 matrix for a short amount of time.
    The behavior of the graph apppears to linearly increase as the simulation is a continuos spiral. Altough I think there might be a bug
    as I would expect it to take a sinosodial form as the system is fluctuating sa spirals.

part (c)
    


part (d)
    This is unfortunatly taking too long to run however I have wrote the code to plot it also.

part (e)
    I have written the code to record the data and plot however I was not able to plot it as the simulation
    was taking too long.
